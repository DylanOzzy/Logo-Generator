## Project Overview

I made this Command Line Interface (CLI) for the purpose of saving the time of generating personalized logos. I also created this application to test my experience with Javascript, NodeJS, Node Package Manager and Jest testing.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- NPM

## Features

- User is prompted for Logo Test, Text Color, Logo Shape, and Logo Shape Color.
- Colors can be entered by keyword or hexadecimal code. EXAMPLE: "blue" or "#0000ff"
- When all prompts are answered, the logo will be saved to the 'output' folder as 'logo.svg'.
